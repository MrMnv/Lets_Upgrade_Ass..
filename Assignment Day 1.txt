    Ways to Install Python on PC :
      
=======================================================>      Way 1 : Through Python Official Website      <=====================================================================
        
          Step 1 : Goto 
                  https://www.python.org/downloads/
                  
          Step 2 : Click the whichever OS supported version which you use. I'm using Windows(two lines below the Download Python 3.8.4 button[as on 20-07-2020]).
           
          Step 3 : Click on the Download Windows x86-64 executable installer link under the top-left Stable Releases.
              
                The following pop-up window titled Opening python-3.74-amd64.exe will appear.
                
                Download that File
                
                The file named python-3.7.4-amd64.exe should start downloading into your standard download folder. This file is about 30 Mb so it might take a while to download                      fully if you are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 10 seconds over a cable modem).
           
          Step 4 : Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python (and reinstall it easily later, if necessary).
          
          Step 5 : Double-click the icon labeling the file python-3.7.4-amd64.exe[As shown in Windows].
                
                A Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear.
                
                Ensure that the Install launcher for all users (recommended) and the Add Python 3.7 to PATH checkboxes at the bottom are checked.
                
                If the Python Installer finds an earlier version of Python installed on your computer, the Install Now message may instead appear as Upgrade Now (and the                           checkboxes will not appear).
          
          Step 6 : Highlight the Install Now (or Upgrade Now) message, and then click it.
          
                When run, a User Account Control pop-up window may appear on your screen. I could not capture its image, but it asks, Do you want to allow this app to make                         changes to your device.
                
          Step 7 : Click the Yes button.
            
                A new Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup pop-up window will appear with a Setup Progress message and a progress bar.
                
                During installation, it will show the various components it is installing and move the progress bar towards completion. Soon, a new Python 3.7.4 (64-bit) Setup                     pop-up window will appear with a Setup was successfuly message.
                
          Step 8 : Click the Close button.
          
          Python should now be installed.


========================================================>       Way 2 : Using Anaconda Distribution       <======================================================================

          NOTE : Way 1 is not to be done if you chosing way 2.

          Step 1 : Goto 
                  https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
                  
          Step 2 : Select your suppoeted OS download file I'm on Windows. I'll select Windows.
          
          Step 3 : Download the .exe installer.
          
                Please select 64-Bit Graphical Installer (466 MB) [as on 20-07-2020] 
          
          Step 4 :  Once downloaded open and run the .exe installer
          
                At the beginning of the install, you need to click Next to confirm the installation.
                
                Then agree to the license.
                
                At the Advanced Installation Options screen, I recommend that you do not check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable"
                
          Step 5 : Open the Anaconda Prompt from the Windows start menu
          
                After the installation of Anaconda is complete, you can go to the Windows start menu and select the Anaconda Navigator.
          
          Step 6 : As it opens you will see many python code editors like Jupiter Notebook, VS Code, Spyder and many more.
          
          Step 7 : Select anyone and start Coding for becoming Python PRO.
          
         
====================================================>       For Verifying that you installed Python Completely     <=============================================================

          Step 1 : Open Command Prompt.
            
          Step 2 : Write "python"
          
          Step 3 : If it shows python version you installed.
          
           ******** You are Done installing Python Successfully...

  
2.What are Code Environments ? Types ?
Ans.:

      Code Environments :
        A Code environments are a standalone and self-contained environments where you write code, edit code and generate output.
        
      Types of Code Environments :
        
          i. Text Editors :
              
              General Editors like Notepad, Atom, VS Code and many more...
              Works with variety of file types
              Plugins can be added
              
          ii. IDEs [Integreated Development Environments] :
          
              Specifically prepared for specific language
              Many Functionalities are seen
              For Python there is PyCharm and Spider
                
          iii. Notebooks
              
              Inputs and Outputs are seen at line after
              Supports putting heading , notes in between of Codes
              Special file formates but not .py
